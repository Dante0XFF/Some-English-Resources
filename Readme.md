## Some English resources that can be useful for learning
Well, I made this because I mainly learn English offline. These are very good resources, but they don't have an offline or printable version.
Because of that, I decided to make a printable version of them for reading.

It’s easier for me to learn this way. Along with that, they come with easy, every-day examples.

You can’t edit the documents, but you can easily export them to PDF using Word or EPUB using Calibre for reading on your phone or wherever.
